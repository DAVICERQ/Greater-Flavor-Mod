reichelt_jump_title;Reichelt's Last Jump;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reichelt_jump_desc;A somewhat eccentric taylor and inventor, Franz Reichelt drew crowds at the Eiffel Tower to demonstrate his creation, a full-body parachute suit. While local authorities believed he intended to drop a simple dummy from the tower, onlookers were greatly suprised to see Franz himself climb the tower, despite attempts from his friends to delay the jump due to high winds. To the shock and dismay of the crowd (and a visiting film crew), his parachute did not deploy, wrapping itself around the inventor, and he fell to his death sixty meters below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVENTNAMEXXXX;The Mountain Wreath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTDESCXXXX;Ever a poet, our Prince-Bishop Petar has written an epic play he has dubbed 'The Mountain Wreath'. Set in the reign of Danilo I, the founder of the house of Petrovic-Njegoš, the poem focuses on the legendary massacre of Muslim converts on some Christmas day. The ideological nature of the piece has been questioned by some, claiming it glorifies the slaughter of Muslims, while others take it as a true national epic of the Montenegrin people and a literary masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVENTNAMEXXX;The Great Flood of 1862;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTDESCXXXX;Massive floods have spread across much of the West, from the central valley of California to the scrublands of Nevada, to the foothills of the Oregon Cascades. Weeks of torrential downpour have drowned many lowlying areas in ten feet or more of water, turning valleys into lakes, roads into canals, and drowning untold numbers of cattle and humans alike. Reports tell of citizens in Sacramento navigating the city streets on improvised canoes and rafts - of roads, rail, bridges and telegraph lines washed away - and of entire farms, orchards, and mines being destroyed by the rising waters. Above all else thousands have lost their lives, and many more have lost their homes and livelihoods. It will take years for regional infrastructure to recover from the deluge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVENTNAMEXXX;Lijepa Naša Domovino;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTDESCXXXX;Based on a poem by the lyricist Antun Mihanovic, a local composer by the name of Josip Runjanin has composed a patriotic song titled Lijepa naša domovino - "Our beautiful homeland". Quickly adopted by nationalists and patriots across Croatia, it has become an unofficial anthem for Croatia, speaking of the beauty and glory of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVENTDESCXXXX;The Last Portuguese Ibex;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTDESCXXXX;Over the past century, the Ibex has become a much rarer sight in Portugal. Only a small mountain herd was known to exist, and these too were lost from poaching and disease. A work crew managed to capture and photograph a lone goat after first unsuccesfully trying to shoot it, but another has not been found since. Besides the occasional rumored sighting, always without clear evidence, it may be safe to assume that the Ibex has finally disappeared from the hills of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTOPTAXXX;Adeus, Ibex.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTNAMEXXX;Semana de Arte Moderna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTDESCXXXX;A great weeklong festival of modernist art has been held at the Municipal Theater of São Paulo, with events featuring poetry, paintings, concerts, and lectures. However, conflict and controversy plauged the event, with new movements forming out of the division - such as the "Anthropophagics", who seek to create a new Brazilian art out of the 'cannibalizing' of European and American art - and the highly nativist Nationalists, who seek to create a new and purely Brazilian modernism. In addition to the ripples in the domestic art sphere, the event has also served to promote São Paulo to a modern cultural capital of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVENTOPTAXXX;Now, what happened to the art of the good ol days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
