MON_claim_ragusa_title;Claim Dubrovnik;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_claim_skadar_desc;Skadar, also known as Shkodra, Shkoder or Scutari, is an important town on the other side of the lake that carries the same name and the historical capital of our predecessor, the old land of Zeta. While the town and its area are inhabited majoritly by Albanians, to control it would be paramount to resolve the irrigation issues in Old Montenegro. Some are already going as far as to claim that our future relies on the control of this town. Let us officially stake our claim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_claim_serbian_leadership_title;Assume Leadership of the Serbs by Force;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_claim_serbian_leadership_desc;NOTE: Serbia may retaliate! While usually on very friendly terms, the reign of prince and later king Nikola I. of Montenegro was marked by his struggles with the Serbian Karadordevic and Obrenovic dynasties over the rulership of all Serbs. It was believed locally that Montenegro was the sole remnant and inheritor of the medieval Serbian Empire, from which its restoration will eventually come from. Historically, a dynastic union was almost achieved when a royal marriage between Montenegro and Serbia, that would put the Petrovic-Njegos dynasty in the line of succession, was agreed upon. This was, however, thwarted when the pro-Russian Karadordevic dynasty was restored in Serbia and Russia chose Serbia as its main horse in the race. We can either attempt to proceed peacefully with the royal marriage and a little... accident, or we can simply march to Belgrade and enforce our leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MONTYMEN_DESC;Against all odds, we, the Montenegrins, are now the leaders of the Serbians. However, there are still some cultural differences present between our two people and we must take a stance on the future of our culture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_become_serbia_tsar_desc;Ever since the Battle of Kosovo, the Serbian Empire has lain dead at the feet of the Turks. However, one indomitable retreat of Serbs has persisted in the former Zetan land. This retreat became known as Crna Gora - Montenegro. The sole true heir to the Serbian Empire.

MON_restore_pec_title;Restore the Patriarchate of Pec;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_restore_pec_desc;The Patriarchate of Pec Monastery is a medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery located near the city of Peja. Built in the 13th century, it became the residence of Serbian Archbishops. In 1346, when the Serbian Patriarchate of Pec was created, the Monastery became the seat of Serbian Patriarchs. The monastery complex consists of several churches, and during medieval and early modern times it was also used as mausoleum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs. The monastery church is unique in Serbian medieval architecture, with three churches connected as one whole, with a total of four churches. After 1737, the Phanariotes embarked on policy initiatives that led to the exclusion of Serbs in the succession of the patriarchate, which was eventually abolished in September 1766. At the beginning of the First Balkan War, army of the Kingdom of Montenegro entered into Pec. By the Treaty of London, the region of Pec was officially awarded to Montenegro and the Monastery of Pec again became an episcopal seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC601;Our little brother in the Balkans, Montenegro, sometimes nicknamed as "Serbian Sparta", has humbly requested that we support their endeavors to develop their country and defend against the Turks.

MON_nag_for_money_desc;Our land is small and poor and we cannot easily attain prosperity. Luckily, our great protector in the east may be willing to help us out.

MON_marry_serbia_title;Marry into Serbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_marry_serbia_desc;Ever in the struggle over the leadership of the Serbian people, our lord Nikola and his advisors have presented a curious scheme: the prince Mirko, duke of Grahovo, will marry Natalija Konstantinovic, a granddaughter of Anna Obrenovic, one of the two competing dynasties in Serbia. By extension, a clause in the marriage agreement will stipulate that were the Serbian monarch Alexander to die with no children, the crown of Serbia will pass exactly to prince Mirko. That way, the house of Petrovic-Njegoš would be the sole ruler of the Serbs. While Mirko is not our firstborn, we could convince the crown prince Danilo to refuse the throne later. Let us send an offer to Belgrade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_606_DESC;"Onamo, 'namo!" (There, o'er there!) was a popular anthem in Montenegro in the late 19th to early 20th century. The music was composed by Davorin Jenko or Franjo Vimer, partly drawing upon a song of Garibaldi's fighters, "Si scopron le tombe, Si levano i morti," with words written by prince Nicholas I of Montenegro. Having words that were considered too inflammatory, evoking provocation of the Ottoman Empire, it could not be used as the official state anthem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_613_DESC;Our adoption of Onamo 'Namo as our national anthem has apparantly outraged the Turks so much that they have decided to muster armies against us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_607_DESC;Ever in the struggle over the leadership of the Serbian people, the Montenegrin lord Nikola has presented us a curious scheme: his son, prince Mirko, the duke of Grahovo, will marry Natalija Konstantinovic, a granddaughter of Anna Obrenovic. By extension, a clause in the marriage agreement will stipulate that were our lord Alexander to die with no children, the crown of Serbia will pass exactly to prince Mirko. That way, the two Serbian states shall finally be united under one dynasty. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_610_DESC;The Montenegrins have published "Onamo, 'namo!" (There, o'er there!), a poem with inflammatory text referencing the killing Turks and the old glory of Serbia, aimed to rouse the Serbs against our rule. It is already hailed as a "Serbian Marseillase".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_611_DESC;The Montenegrins have published "Onamo, 'namo!" (There, o'er there!), a poem with inflammatory text referencing the killing Turks and the old glory of Serbia, aimed to rouse the Serbs against our rule. It is not only already hailed as a "Serbian Marseillase", but the Montenegrins have also had the gall to name this mockery their national anthem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_DANILO_DEATH;Prince Danilo was assassinated in August 1860, as he was boarding a ship at the port of Kotor. The assassin was Todor Kadic from the Bjelopavlici clan, which did not recognize his rulership. Nikola, Danilo's nephew, succeeded Danilo as the next secular Prince of Montenegro. After centuries of theocratic rule, Danilo was the first Montenegrin secular prince who did not hold the ecclesiastical position of the Vladika. He was planning to upgrade the status of Montenegro turning it into a kingdom but did not live long enough to see his ambitions realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_GORSKI_VJENAC;Gorski Vjenac (The Mountain Wreath) is a poem and a play written by Prince-Bishop and poet Petar II Petrovic-Njegoš. Njegoš wrote The Mountain Wreath during 1846 in Cetinje and published it the following year after the printing in an Armenian monastery in Vienna. It is a modern epic written in verse as a play, thus combining three of the major modes of literary expression. Set in 18th-century Montenegro, the poem deals with attempts of Njegoš's ancestor Metropolitan Danilo I Petrovic-Njegoš to regulate relations among the region's warring tribes. Written as a series of fictitious scenes in the form of dialogues and monologues, the poem opens with Metropolitan Danilo's vision of the spread of Turkish power in Europe. Torn by inner conflict he sees that the struggle is inevitable, but dreads the issues. The poem is considered a masterpiece of Serbian and Montenegrin literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We shall make them an offer where we give them Iskodra, a part of the Adriatic coast and part of eastern Herzegovina... in exchange for their loyalty. However, Montenegro's allies might not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_TUR_OFFER;An emissary from the Sultan has presented us a curious offer: wary of the raids we conduct on Ottoman land and our territorial ambition, the Porte offers to give us control of Skadar, a part of the Adriatic coast and a part of eastern Herzegovina... in exchange for bending a knee to Constantinople. How do we reply?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
