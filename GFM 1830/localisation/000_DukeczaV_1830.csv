slavery_abolition_act_ENG_desc;The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 passed unopposed in the House of Commons and came into force a year later. It sought after the gradual abolition of slavery in all parts of the British Empire. Though in practical terms, only slaves below the age of six were freed in her Colonies, while slaves above the age of six were now known as "apprentices," not all apprentices would be free until 1840. The only territories excluded from the Slavery Abolition Act were East India Company, Ceylon, and Saint Helena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1831_reform_riots_desc;The reform riots of $YEAR$ were a series of riots in many British towns from London to Sherborne. Civil unrest ran amock in the streets due to the recently proposed Second Reform Bill failing to pass in Parliament. The civil disturbance got out of control in the towns of Nottingham, Derby, and Bristol. In Nottingham, rioting broke out after a public meeting reverted to violence. Many private homes belonging to opponents of the reform had their homes targeted by the riots leading to the Castle of Nottingham, home of the anti-reform Duke of Newcastle, being engulfed in flames alongside jails and a silk mill in Beeston. The Bristol riots of $YEAR$ are the biggest of the $YEAR$ Reform riots. Lasting for three days, it has cost us 300,000 pounds worth of damage alongside 250 casualties. A trial took place and sentenced a total of 102 people, 22 going to Australia, 42 imprisoned, and another 31 sentenced to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
poor_law_amendment_act_desc;The Poor Law Amendment Act of $YEAR$, or New Poor Law as it was widely known, was an act passed in the territory of England and Wales by Earl Grey and his Whig government that replaced the Poor Law of 1601, previously in place. It sought to transfer the poor rural workers to urbanised areas and protect the urban ratepayers from paying too much. It was impossible to implement the act fully, especially in the industrialised north, as it suffered from cyclical unemployment. Opposition towards the PLAA came from all sectors of society, be it rural workers being against the diet in Workhouses, claiming they barely sustained the workers' health and nutrition, all the way to politicians and religious leaders. All this anger towards the PLAA led to the amending of the amendment act removing most restrictions and measures in workhouses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
