reform_act_1832_desc;The Reform Act of 1832 would change the English electoral system to "fix" and shield it from further abuse. The Act would cause the abolition of 143 borough seats in England and create 132 new counties in their place. The voting franchise would also be extended: Now, 250,000 (an increase of 60%) more British subjects would be allowed to vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

slavery_abolition_act_ENG_desc;The proposed Slavery Abolition Act seeks the gradual abolition of slavery in all parts of the British Empire. Though in practical terms, only slaves below the age of six would be freed in the colonies, while slaves above the age of six would now be known as "apprentices," not all of which would be free for several years. The only territories excluded from the Slavery Abolition Act would be the Honorable East India Company, Ceylon, and Saint Helena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1831_reform_riots_desc;A series of riots has struck many British towns from London to Sherborne. Civil unrest has run amock in the streets due to the recently proposed Second Reform Bill failing to pass in Parliament. The civil disturbance got completely out of control in the towns of Nottingham, Derby, and Bristol. In Nottingham, rioting broke out after a public meeting had reverted to violence. Many private homes belonging to opponents of the reform were targeted by the rioters, leading to the Castle of Nottingham, home of the anti-reform Duke of Newcastle, being engulfed in flames alongside jails and a silk mill in Beeston. Bristol in particular has seen the biggest riots, lasting for three days and has costing us 300,000 pounds worth of damage alongside 250 casualties. A trial has taken place and sentenced a total of 102 people, 22 sent to Australia, 42 imprisoned, and another 31 sentenced to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
poor_law_amendment_act_desc;Earl Grey and his Whig government have passed the Poor Law Amendment Act of $YEAR$, or New Poor Law as it is widely known. It replaces the Poor Law of 1601 that was previously in place. It seeks to transfer poor rural workers to urbanised areas and protect the urban ratepayers from paying too much. Although, implementing the act fully is impossible, especially in the industrialised north, as it suffers from cyclical unemployment. Opposition towards the PLAA comes from all sectors of society, be it rural workers against the diet in workhouses, claiming they barely sustain the workers' health and nutrition, all the way to politicians and religious leaders. All this anger towards the PLAA has led to an amendment being made to the amendment act to remove most restrictions and measures previously implemented regarding workhouses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
