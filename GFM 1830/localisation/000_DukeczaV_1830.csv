slavery_abolition_act_ENG;The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 passed unopposed in the House of Commons and came into force a year later. It sought after the gradual abolition of slavery in all parts of the British Empire. Though in practical terms, only slaves below the age of six were freed in her Colonies, while slaves above the age of six were now known as "apprentices," not all apprentices would be free until 1840. The only territories excluded from the Slavery Abolition Act were East India Company, Ceylon, and Saint Helena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
