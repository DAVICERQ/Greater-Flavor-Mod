1833_reforms_title;The Reforms of 1833;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833_reforms_desc;President Valentín Gomez Farias has proposed several social, political and economic reforms to curb the power of the Catholic Church in Mexico. Liberals compare the clergy to ministers of Huitzilopochtli (who received human sacrifices), accusing them of being being worldly, greedy hypocrites. They see the Bible as full of absurdities and falsehoods from an ignorant era and wish to disempower the pope. Conservatives are furious about the proposals and the disrespect to the church, seeing them as reason to depose Farias.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC183536;After president Valentín Gomez Farias implemented his liberal reforms in 1833, revoking power from the Church and military, conservatives have attempted to depose him and establish a new constitution. Farias's unpopularity has even caused his vice president, Antonio López de Santa Anna, to defect from him and join the coup, eventually taking power as the new Mexican president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183536;Santa Anna is a national hero. Leave him in charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME183637;Separatist Movements Arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183637;Disaster is sweeping the nation! Reports claim that, in response to the implementation of our constitution, many separatists rebellions have formed across the country, with the Texans declaring independence right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183637;Fight those rebels! Defend the constitution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB183637;This is hopeless. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44806;A general and hero of the Mexican War of Independence, Santa Anna is now the current president of Mexico. After the deposal of the liberal president Valentín Gomez Farias, Santa Anna has repealed the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with the church and the military's support. Many Mexican states have objected against Santa Anna's centralization of power. The state of the country is now at risk of crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44806OPTA;Santa Anna's rule is above all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTA;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTB;We shall surrender our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207010;The peoples in the south of our Kingdom are mainly Flemings and Walloons, Roman Catholics which are unhappy with how our government treats them, being subjugated by a mostly protestant north. Many liberals are claiming His Majesty King William I as a despotic ruler. Unemployemen and industrial unrest in the working classes has also contributed to the turmoil. Riots have erupted in Brussels, shops looted, Theatregoes joined the movement right after watching the nationalistic opera La muette de Portici. These rebels soon have started talking about seccesion and the States-General in brussels voted in favour of seccesion and declared independence. It's time to decide what are we going to do about this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207011;We have gloriously defeated the Dutch! Our independence has been secured and the Kingdom of Belgium has been born! Now we can appoint Leopold I as King of the Belgians and stablish an official government! Glory to Belgium! Glory to Flanders! Glory to Walloonia! Glory to the Kingdom of Belgium!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207012;The London Conference of $YEAR$ has been proclaimed. We have been invited to take a seat and discuss about the independence of Belgium. This is mostly a diplomatic settlement, as The Kingdom of Belgium is de facto independent. Nevertheless, we can get something from this, depending on what we choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207027;The State of Zacatecas has rebelled against our constitution. Francisco García Salinas, the governor of the state, is leading a small army of about four thousand men at the head of the revolt. To supress the rebellion, General Santa Anna has headed to Zacatecas with an army to handle the situation himself, leaving General Miguel Barragán as presidenct in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mexican_securalization_law_desc;The Congress of the Union has proposed an Act to secularize all Californian missions, transferring ownership form the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church to the Mexican authorities, this is because of potential Spanish influence and power in California because most Spanish missions in California are still loyal to the Roman Catholic Church in Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207028;After Spain tried to reconquer us in 1829, Bustamante was put in charge of a reserve army, which he used to revolt against President Guerrero. His movement succeeded and Bustamante was recognized as President of the republic just today. There are some conflicts occurring right now with the deputies as legally, Vicente Guerrero is still President and in his absense, José María Bocanegra should assume the functions as Vicepresident, which meant Bustamante was usurping the role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207029;General Juan José Codallos has rose up in arms against the Plan of Jalapa in which Bustamante got his title as President and issued a document with eleven articles in which among the most important ones, he desired to re-instate Vicente Guerrero as the President of the Mexican Republic. We have been informed of rebels marching all around the coast of Jalisco!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207030;The war might have continued longer, but it has ended in what one could call 'the most shocking single event in the history of Mexico', the capture of Vicente Guerrero in Acapulco, through an act of betrayal and his execution a month later. Guerrero was lured into a boat by an Italian merchant ship captain, Francisco Picaluga, and turned over to federal troops in Huatulco, where he was captured and tried in Oaxaca City.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207031;Our victory against the Central Government finally allow us to bring back Vicente Guerrero into Presidency, and let Mexico be ruled once again by the liberal party, let's hope this means peace in the future for the Mexican Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207032;The officers of the Veracruz and San Juan de Ulúa's fort garrisons gathered in the house of Colonel Pedro Landero, in which they agreed to support The 1824 Federal Constitution of The United Mexican States, the demotion of all ministers implemented during the centralist regime, and that Antonio López de Santa Anna will be the one that oversees negotiations with Vicepresident Bustamante and other authorities. Santa Anna was the true hidden organizer of the Plan, and after rebels captured a convoy with munitions, money and supplies, the revolt began, but it was not until recently that the garrisons of Toluca, Tejupilco, Puebla, Guanajuato, Querétaro, Michoacán, Tlaxcala, Jalisco, Acapulco, Oaxaca and Aguascalientes have joined the rebellion in which has turned into a full-blown civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207033;The Zavaleta Conventions were meetings in which Antonio López de Santa Anna, Anastasio Bustamante and Manuel Gómez Pedraza signed up an agreement in Puebla, with this treaty, Manuel Gómez Pedraza assumed the Presidency of Mexico and by this, the constitutional order went back to normal, this also meant that the republican and federal system returned, as well as general amnisty for the events that took place on September 1st, 1828..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207034;After Santa Anna was proclaimed as 'Protector of the Catholic Religion' by the clergy on May 16th, and 'Sustainer of the Religion and the Patriotic Liberties' on May 23rd, on May 25th, in the town of Cuernavaca, Ignacio Echeverría and José Mariano Campos have proclaimed the Plan of Cuernavaca, in which they demand to, derogate the Ley del Caso and not tolerate any Masonic influences. Declare as nule the laws emitted by the Congress of the Union and the Local Legislatures and request the protection of President Santa Anna for the plan and recognize him as the only authority. More than 100 town halls have already declared their addition to the Plan of Cuernavaca and after the members of the Chambers tried to gather, they found themselves with the keys of the salon lost and the doors closed and protected by rebel armed forces. Santa Anna replied that sessions coult not continue any longer outside the period signed in the COnstitution. Santa Anna has set his posture publishing a manifesto to the people, in which he expressed to be willing to defend the wishes of the people to keep the catholic religion unharmed and that he had 'implored' to the Chambers the derogation of some laws to clam down agitations. Soon after, Santa Anna's mask fell off and he dissolved the Capital's town hall, and announced his decision to join the Plan of Cuernavaca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
