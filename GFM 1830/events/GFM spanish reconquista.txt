Over the course of the past two decades, the Spanish crown has suffered a great deal of internal stability as well as failures to reestablish control over the rebellious colonies. As of now, not a single colony on the mainland remains under Spanish authority. While the government officially maintains that these colonial possessions are still rightfully Spanish territories, it is time that the ultimate decision be made as to its course. Shall this lost cause be pursued further in hopes of a victory that has not yet come, or shall it cut its losses?"
